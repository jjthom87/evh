# API APP

<h1>Goal:</h1>

Develop an app that takes a command as an argument to know which api to call:

For example: ```node app.js geocoder atlanta``` will make a call to your geocoder api, looking up information for Atlanta

<h2>Assignment:</h2></br>
Use the yelp, youtube, and geocoder api in node to make calls and parse information.</br></br>

Your command line should take four commands:
* Node
* ```<File Name>```
* Api you're using
* Search Query

After the command is entered, parse information from the api in neat and organized console.logs</br>
We will work in class to get access to the different APIs

<strong>Bonus:</strong></br>
* Export/import each different api as a function from another .js file</br>
* Write these items to a text file in a nice format</br>
* Read the items that you wrote to a text file</br>

<strong>Grading Criteria:</strong></br>
* Functions are created for 2 of the 3 apis</br>
* Command line arguments are used correctly</br>
* Effort and Care for structure/architecture are shown</br>

<strong>Complete</strong> = Meets all grading criteria above.</br>
<strong>Incomplete</strong> = Does not meet all grading criteria above. Needs improvement or missing submission.
