/*

1. Create a 'performers' table that has:
  * an id field
  * a field for the name of an actor or actress
  * other information about an actor or actress (age, bio)
2. Create a 'moviesTwo' table (because we already created a 'movies' table) that has:
  * an id field
  * movie name field
  * has a foreign key of the performers id
3. Practice with constraints on fields
4. Do some inserts into both table.
  * Do some successful inserts
  * Do some inserts that are rejected as well
