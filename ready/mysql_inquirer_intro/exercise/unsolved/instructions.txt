Using the inquirer and mysql Modules:
1. get all of the records in the 'country_people' & 'students' table
2. get the last record in the 'country_people' & 'students' table

1. You will use inquirer to prompt which table you would like to view the records for
2. After you choose which table, you will give the user a choice if they want to see all of the records or the last record added
3. If they choose to see all the records, log all of the records
4. If they choose to see the last record added, log the last record added
