/*
	We will be working with the one to one relationship between the
	'users' & 'users_profiles' table.
	If you do not have these, the schema to create them is in the schema.sql

	Look at the use of functions here
	Look at the use of nesting here ... meaning, i'm waiting for one database call
	to be done before execusting another call on the database

	If we didn't use nesting, and had all of the query calls in the global scope,
	they would not go in order, they would try to fire all of them out of order.
	This is asynchronous behavior by javascript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Concepts.
