- Please view the video in this directory as a guide for the solution

# Instructions
- Install From NPM:
  - Express
  - MySQL
  - Body Parser
- You will be utilizing the database with the schema that is included as part of this project (in the schema.sql)
- You will be using all of the CRUD Operations:
  * Read/Get:
    - When the page loads, get all of the guestbook messages
    - When a new post is made, make sure to show the new post on the ui as well as the old posts
    - When an update is made to a message, do a release  to make sure to update the html with the new values
    - When a message is delete, do a read to make sure to update the page without the value that you deleted
  * Create/Post:
    - Inserting a new message (The Form) into the database
    - Once a new message is inserted, update the page with that new message
  * Update/Put:
    - When you hover over a message and click on that message,
      a modal will pop up with a form that will let you update that message.
    - Once you submit the form, the page and database will be updated with the new message value.

  * Delete/Delete:
    - When you click on the RED X that belongs to that message, the message
      will be deleted from the database and then the page should be updated
      without that deleted message there
